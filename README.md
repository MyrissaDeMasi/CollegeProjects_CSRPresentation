# Corporate Social Responsibility: More Than Just Profits  
*BUS100 – Introduction to Business*

This was one of my favorite projects from my Business 100 class. I got to take a deeper look at Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and challenge Milton Friedman’s old-school claim that the only job of a business is to make money.

But businesses are made of people. And people deserve more.

In this presentation, I explored how real responsibility in business goes beyond profit — touching lives through ethical practices, environmental care, community support, and long-term economic sustainability. I broke CSR down into four categories and looked at how it connects with trust, transparency, and purpose.

This project helped shape how I see business as an HR student — not just as a system, but as a space where values matter.
